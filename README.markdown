# FizzBuzz

...is a classic programming quiz that many a computer science student has cut their teeth on. 

The concept is to print out, using code, every number from 1 to 100. The catch is change every number that is divisible by 3 into the word "Fizz", change every number that is divisible 5 into "Buzz", and change any number divisible by BOTH 3 and 5 into "FizzBuzz."

Here is a possible variation of code that would solve the problem in a couple different languages.

Now, I could have easily gone around the internet and did some copy and paste of this code but I didn't. This is all hand-coded without an IDE. I only used Sublime text editor. 

The details of environments are contained as comments in each file. 

That's it. Feel free to fork, improve the code, or create a new file that provides a different way to solve the problem.
